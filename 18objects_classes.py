""" You use the phrase is-a when you talk about objects and classes being related to each other by a class relationship. You use has-a when you talk about objects and classes that are related only because they reference each other. A class inherits from the class named object to make a class but it’s not an object really it’s a class, but do not forget to inherit from object."""
